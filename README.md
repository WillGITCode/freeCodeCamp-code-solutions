# freeCodeCamp-code-solutions
This repository is not one complete piece of software. But a collection of the code I wrote as I was learning Web Devolopment from the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It includes problems, projects and algorithms, all of which are posted here as I submited them while learning.

I will continue to contribute here while persuing freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Development Certificate.
If you are also a FCC camper and would like to contribute feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
Any typo fixes, examples or enhanced explanations would be appreciated.
However I will not be accepting solutions to problems as this repo is an educational showcase of my development.

If you are interested in submiting fixes (other than to my code) to this repo please follow FreeCodeCamp's guide here:
